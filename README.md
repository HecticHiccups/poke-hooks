## poke_hooks
introduction to hooks with pokemon api

## Motivation
I was motivated by the desire to understand hooks in a more fundamental way without "cra". 

## Installation
- Live server is needed for this to run your index file
- Ensure you have every cdn url as you see it on this repo

## How to use..
- It's interesting to understand how react works under the hood..
- You can destructure all the necessary modules from react & place them at the top
- You can also notice the transition of useState -> useReducer 
- This example is rather messy but can be valauble to remember your fundamentals
